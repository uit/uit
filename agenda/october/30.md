###Halloween Spookathon!

The UIT Halloween Spookathon is meant to be a fun exercise! Come up with whatever creative idea you want. It should be _something useful_, fun or scary for halloween. The key difficulty in a hackathon is always completing the idea in a short amount of time. This means you should think of an idea that's easy. You'll have around 10 hours to design and build your idea, and put your presentation together.



- ***Rules***
  - 1 to 4 Students per Team.
  - Your team will create a repo on github called uit-spookathon.
  - Push to Github every hour.


- ***Voting***
  - Everyone can vote three times. You can only give one vote per team, and you can't vote for your own. The most votes wins!

- ***Prizes***
  - Will be announced soon, boo!
