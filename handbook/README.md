#UIT Handbook

## Values

- ***Learning*** - Knowing how to learn is very important. You'll never know everything but be confident that you can learn anything. This attitude is your most valuable asset. Learning new concepts and skills will be a struggle. It will take time and effort. Embrace the struggle. Be a lifelong learner.

- ***Focus*** - Set aside uninterrupted time to focus on your projects. If you're with others, wear headphones. Close out distractions like social media, phone, and email. Everything can wait. Enter into a deep state of work. This is when you'll be the most productive. Get in the zone!

- ***Communication*** - Share, help, and colloborate regularily. Ask anyone a question at anytime (unless they have their headphones on). Answer anyone's question at anytime. Don't act surprised if someone doesn't know something (it was new to you at one point too). Share short status updates. Sum up your progress and describe your plans. It helps everyone to know what you're up to and it helps you to be honest and accountable. Work together. Break into small groups. Pair code. Watch videos. Talk through ideas.

- ***Reliability*** - Be on time. Be available. Let everyone know if you cannot be on time or available. Finish your project. Be known for being reliable.

- ***Creativity*** - Creativity is valued. Make things interesting. Make things inspiring. Use your imagination. Have a vision.

## Methods

- ***Blog*** - Write at least one blog post each week. Describe what you've learned. Detail what you've accomplished. Link to your project code, domain, and deck. Give credit to people or resources that helped you.

- ***GitHub*** - Push your project code to GitHub regularily. Do this everytime you take a break from development.

- ***Present*** - Take the presentations seriously. This is your moment to display what you have accomplished and where you are going. Be inspiring. Improve each week. Give constructive feedback to others. Take the feedback you receive into consideration.

- ***Update*** - Everyday, send a short status update to the #general channel in chat. Use the #update tag. Between one sentence and two paragraphs is appropriate. Include relevant links and images.
