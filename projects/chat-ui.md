#Chat UI

##Description

In this project, you’ll create a client-side, chat [user interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) (UI) that enables a user to add new messages to a list. To add a new message, the user can type messages in a form and either hit the enter key, or press a “send” button.

This project will give you experience with web structure (HTML), style (CSS), coding (JavaScript), [DOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) Manipulation, [Version Control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control), and Form Validation. Below you’ll find resources to help you research and practice these concepts.

In order to teach you the fundamentals, do not use external libraries or third-party code for this project. No jquery, jqueryui, bootstrap, etc. Write everything from scratch!

##Instructions

Create a git repository called `simple-chat-interface`. In your repo, create 3 new files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. Add and commit these files to your repo.

In HTML (index.html), you’ll create the structure of your application. Place the elements that you’ll need on the page, including form inputs/buttons, and a div to hold messages. HTML is also where you’ll include your JavaScript and CSS files.

In JavaScript (script.js), you’ll put your applications logic. You can create an `addMessage` function that handles adding new message elements to your page. You should validate the messages being added. If the user adds a blank message your application should complain. If the user begins their message with a slash (“/”) your app should respond “unknown command”. Bonus: Add some commands to your app. For example, `/nick <new user name>` will change a user’s name. Or `/color <hex value>` will change the font color for new messages.

In CSS (style.css) you can style your UI. For example, you can design a color palette for your application, choose a nice font, and style your form’s inputs/buttons.

Each time you make a change, test it out to make sure it works. You should test it in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox. Each time you add a new feature that works, commit the change in git.

Each time you take a break from developing, push your changes to github.
